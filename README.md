# Australian-Bushfire-Analysis-and-Prediction
Predicting bushfires is important for the Australian community because it helps reduce the impact of fire on Australiaâ€™s people, environment and economy.
Improved knowledge of how bushfires spread is critical for emergency management operations, risk prediction and timely issuing of warnings. Bushfire seasons are getting longer and outbreaks of severe bushfire weather are becoming more frequent. Predicting when and where bushfires are likely to occur is an important part of bushfire management.
